LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

In our proposed system we maintain the Design Software in which the search can be based on various field such as Book ID, Member ID, Issued Books etc. In this system we are going to maintain the Record of Library Members, Issued Books, & Returned Books.
The main objective of the proposed system is that any modification can be made by just the touch of a button instead of going through directory and keep on turning pages.

The proposed system will contain the following:
1.	Information of the Library’s i.e. Books And Members..
2.	It keeps track of all the Issued Books & Returned Books.
3.	It keeps track of all the Book’s Details.
4.	It keeps all the contact Information about all the Library Members.
5.	Contact Information can also be updated when needed.
6.	It also keeps track of all joined members and left members.
7.	It is also capable of making changes in Library’s data.
